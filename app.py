# --- BACKGROUND ---
st.markdown ("""I'm Diana Rose C. Mesa, a computer engineering student from Surigao del Norte State University. For me, engineering is more than just a degree; it's a gateway to realizing technology's promise and developing meaningful solutions that can change the future. With each step forward on my path, I am motivated by curiosity and a desire to understand more about how systems work and how I can improve them. 

Beyond my education, I like the basic yet meaningful parts of life. Watching movies helps me to explore a variety of stories and ideas, whereas keeping my room clean provides me with a sense of quiet and order‚Äîa balance that I value greatly as I negotiate the pressures of college life. Moments of reflection fuel my motivator and a reminder of the value of discipline and attention.

I regard myself as a motivated and passionate learner who wants to progress not only technically but also personally. My goals extend beyond academic accomplishment; I want to make a lasting influence in my area and welcome the challenges that come with it. With each new experience, I am laying the groundwork for a future full of invention, resilience, and purpose.""",
